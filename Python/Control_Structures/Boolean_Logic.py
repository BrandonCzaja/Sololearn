# Boolean logic operators are (and, or, not)
# print(1 == 1 and 2 == 2)
# print(1 == 1 and 2 == 3)
# print(1 != 1 and 2 == 2)
# print(2 < 1 and 3 > 6)


# Example of boolean logic with an if statement
# I can either leave the expressions unwrapped, wrap each individual statement or wrap the whole if condition in ()
if (1 == 1 and 2 + 2 > 3):
